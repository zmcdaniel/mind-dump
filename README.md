# Mind Dump

## About

A linguistic analysis service. Breaks your text input down into emotion, social, and language categories to help you gain more insight into your communication and thinking habits. In addition to boosting creativity through stream-of-consciousness writing, Mind Dump utilizes IBM's Watson platform to perform a 'tone check' to provide insights about three types of tones in a piece of text including emotion (negative emotions, cheerfulness, anger), social propensities (openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness), and writing styles (analytical, confident, and tentative). The end goal is to provide data-driven insignt into one's inner thoughts to better prioritize, synchronize, and live a more mindful day
